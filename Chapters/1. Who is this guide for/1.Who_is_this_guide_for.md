**Who is this guide for**

This guide is meant for both programmers and non-programmers, theory and
practice will be kept separate so that you can skip the theory you
already know if you want to.

**If you are an already experienced programmer:**

I suggest you to skip all the teory in the first part (variables, flow
control,...), but still if you never programmed in an object-oriented
language you should read the more advanced theory, because it's language
specific.

**If you are new to programming:**

Read the whole guide and don't skip theory, it may be boring, but
without it you are not going anywhere; don't worry if you don't
understand some concepts the first time, read it again and try doing
some tests to understand how it works.
