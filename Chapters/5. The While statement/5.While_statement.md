**While statement - theory**

The while statement is *drum roll* another flow control, it repeats a
piece of code as long as a condition is satisfied. The while statement
and the for statement (we’ll see this soon) are also called loops,
because they *loop* code. His flow chart would look like

You must be careful with the while statement, because you could create
an endless loop.

**While statement - practice**

The while syntax as you could have guessed is

while (condition){\
code to execute\
}

If the condition always returns true your program will crash, so don’t
do things like this

int x=10;\
while (x&gt;0){\
Console.WriteLine(“Ehi!”);\
}

And for the while statements it’s all, enjoy!

**While statement - assignment**

Code a program that given a number as input prints all the numbers from
0 to that number.

TIPS:

-   To convert a string into an integer you can use the
    Int32.Parse(value) method, the input must be a string and the output
    will be an integer

-   Similarly to convert an integer into a string: integer.ToString()
    where integer is your int variable

BONUS POINT:

-   Check if the input is negative and if so respond with an error

SOLUTION:

Console.WriteLine(“Write the number here: ”); //ask the user for the
number

string userinput= Console.ReadLine(); //read what the user wrote

> int number= Int32.Parse(userinput); //converts the user input to
> integer\
> int x=0; //sets the x to 0\
> if (number&gt;=0){ //makes sure that the number is greater than 0\
> while (x&lt;=number){\
> Console.WriteLine(x.ToString()); //prints x\
> x++; //adds 1 to x\
> }\
> } else{\
> Console.WriteLine(“Error: number smaller than 0”); //prints the error\
> }\
> Console.ReadLine(); //we use this command to prevent the windows from
> closing
