**Getting started**

To program in C\# you will need a text editor and a compiler, you can
use whatever you want, but I highly recommend Visual Studio: it's both a
text editor and a compiler, it has amazing features that help you
writing and debugging the code and it's free.

You can download it here:

In the installation make sure to install all the c\# packages

Take your time, I can wait...

Done? Great so run Visual Studio, click that "New Project..." button and
choose the Visual C\# Console Application template.
